SNAKE GAME

Run the server, then the client twice.
Type in a name for each player.
When two names have been entered, the game automatically starts.

Directions are given in game aswell.

Each time you press a movment key, the snake will move. 
If you move the snake through to the over screen, then you lose possession of the snake and the other player takes over control.
The aim of the game is to get 50 fruit, without the snake biting itself or crashing into a wall.
